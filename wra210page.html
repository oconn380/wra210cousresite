<h1>About Me: Jake OConnor </h1>

<p>My name is Jake O'Connor, I was born in Royal Oak Michigan. I grew up in Novi Michigan.
I have two younger siblings. I am currently majoring in XA design at Michigan State
University.  Some of my hobbies include listening to and playing music, writing poetry,
going for walks and playing video games with my roomates. Some instruments that I can
play are the bass guitar, electric and acoustic guitar, the drums and the trumpet.
I have always wanted to learn the piano as well but it is way harder than I thought it
would be and I havent really had time to put a ton of effort into it. I used to play a
lot of soccer as well but I broke my foot my senior year of highschool and I can't run
on it very well anymore. </p>

<h2> Design Philosophy</h2>
    
   <li> I will make an effort to be inclusive of everyone and host a site that is both easily
   accessible and easily used by everyone. I believe that knowledge should be free to those who
   have the desire to learn, and that no one is more or less intelligent than another person but
   instead that intelligence appears in different forms.  The information on my site should
   reflect this ideal in the sense that no one should have a hard time accessing or reading its
   content. </li>
   
	<li>My first goal is to learn how to create a website that follows the web standards.
    In order to achieve this goal my portfolio will need to fill out these web standards. </li>
	<li>My next goal is to Pass the class.  I will need to work hard and do all of the
    assignments and try as hard as i can.</li>
    <li> My last goal is to Be prepared to take advanced web authoring in the future.
    I need to learn the topics covered in this class and master them.</li>
